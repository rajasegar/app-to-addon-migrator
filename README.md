An opinionated cli tool to migrate Ember components from app to addons within a Yarn workspace.

*NOTE:* This cli tool works only with the following conventional folder structure for your Ember app.

```
|-app
|-packages
| |-addons
| |-engines
| | |-dashboards-engine
| | |-tickets-engine

```

## Assumptions made by this tool
- Your Ember app lives in the root of your project folder.
- Engines live under `packages/engines` folder.
- Addons live under `packages/addons` folder.
- You are using [Yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/).
- You are using [POD](https://cli.emberjs.com/release/advanced-use/project-layouts/#podslayout) structure for your components.

## Install
```
npm i -g app-to-addon-migrator
```

## Usage

### 1. ateam (wizard UI)
```
ateam
```

### 2. atam (classic CLI)
```
atam [entity] [entity-name] [dest-folder]
atam route default packages/engines/dashboards-engine
```

After running the above command, the route `default` from `app/routes/default.js` will be
moved to `packages/engines/dashboards-engine/addon/routes/default.js`

### Dry-run
If you just want to see/verify the movement use the `--dry-run` or `-d` option.

```
atam route default packages/engines/dashboards-engine -d
```

This will print something like (without actually copying the files):
```
Moving route.js
---------------
app/routes/helpdesk/default.js
packages/engines/dashboards-engine/addon/routes/default.js


Moving route template.hbs
-------------------------
app/templates/helpdeskdefault.hbs
packages/engines/dashboards-engine/addon/templates/default.hbs

...
```

### skip-tests
If you don't want to move the tests to the addon initially to avoid the overhead use the `--skip-tests` or `--st` option.

```
atam component ui-component/button-component packages/engines/dashboards-engine --skip-tests
```

This will move the tests from the original file structure to a new folder under the addon namespace
inside the host app test folder:

```
Moving component-test.js
-----------------------
app/tests/integration/components/ui-component/button-component/component-test.js
app/tests/packages/engines/dashboards-engine/tests/integration/components/ui-component/button-component-test.js

...
```
### Folder namespace
If your source entities are namespaced within a folder you can use the `-f` option to specify the same
before copying.
Say for example you want to move a component called `widget` from `app/components/dashboards`

```
atam component widget packages/engines/dashboards-engine -f dashboards
```

### Delete Source
If you just want to delete the source files after the movement use the `--delete-source` or `-ds` option.

```
atam route default packages/engines/dashboards-engine -ds
```
